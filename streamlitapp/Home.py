intro="""
The Intelligent Confluence Knowledge Assistant is a state-of-the-art AI-powered system designed to enhance document accessibility and knowledge discovery within an organization. It enables users to query company documentation using natural language, allowing for a seamless and intuitive interaction with vast amounts of corporate knowledge stored in Atlassian Confluence.

By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system ensures accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date responses based on the companyâ€™s internal documentation. Additionally, it provides users with the flexibility to select specific documents for summarization, enabling efficient knowledge extraction tailored to their needs.
